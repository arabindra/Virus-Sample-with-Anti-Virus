## Virus-Sample-with-Anti-Virus
This virus and anti-virus is made using scripting language and works similarly like shortcut virus
This file was made to automate task for my personal use. Later on seeing more computer infected by shortcut virus and seeing it working process, this virus was made that working as similarly as shorcut virus. And anti-vius was made to stop and protect computer from being infected of this both virus.

#### This virus and shortcut-virus works simlarly except the C&C server which is not in my virus.
#### Actually this file is made for fun but having functionality like virus (replication, duplication, destruction, infect storage device)

## Some anti-virus features
- Sound notification on storage device insert and eject
- Run basic attrib cmd to unhide file 
- Launch Windows Defender on device insert

## Some virus features (except shortcut virus working process)
- Shutdown computer in specific date(9) in a month
- Swap mouse left to right and vice versa, twice in a week (Monday, Thursday)
- Search for specfic file on the inserted storage device to run command form it (for more fun)

#### Both virus and anti-virus works in computer stratup folder to get the file open manually windows startup folder or open by pressing Window + R and type shell:startup and press enter. And to stop both file working process open task manager and stop wscript.exe files.

## Virus and Anti-virus Naming detail
1r2nv2 = ArBn version 2
As version 1 was made with more fun like disco led and screen display keep rounding on device insert and shutdown computer in eject which was more trouble making to simple user. So if you are using it then rename the file with the file name inside the code.

#### Note: This virus was FUD (Fully Undetectable) before and no antivirus was able to detect it but later on it spreaded in many computer and now it is even detected with even Window Defender. But change in file name & manipulation in code can make it FUD again.

## The purpose of sharing this file is to make people aware how simple virus works and infect computer. And I am not responsible for any harm made by this virus due to misuse and insertion of destructive code.

# 😁💀 Happy Coding 💀😁
